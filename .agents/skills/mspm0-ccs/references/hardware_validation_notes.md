# Hardware Validation Notes

Use this for verified Tianmengxing MSPM0G3507 lessons and real-board caveats.

## Verified Environment

Validated combination:

- Board: LCKFB Tianmengxing MSPM0G3507
- IDE: CCS / CCS Theia
- SDK: MSPM0 SDK 2.10.00.04
- SysConfig: 1.26.2
- Compiler: TI Arm Clang 4.0.3 LTS
- Debug probe: J-Link through UniFlash / DSLite
- Validated peripherals: PB22 onboard LED, UART0 blocking TX, dual UART DMA TX + IRQ RX, PB22 TIMG8 PWM breathing LED, TIMG12 periodic interrupt
- Validated clock: 80 MHz CPUCLK with MFCLK 4 MHz for UART work

Other boards, packages, SDK versions, CCS versions, probes, and pin maps may work, but they are not guaranteed by these notes.

## Tianmengxing Special Pin Caution

The LCKFB Tianmengxing documentation marks A21, A23, A02, A18, A10, and A11 as special pins and says they should not be used unless necessary. In SysConfig or generated headers these may appear as PA21, PA23, PA02, PA18, PA10, and PA11.

PA10 and PA11 need a narrower rule than the other special pins because Tianmengxing routes them as its default UART connection. When the user asks the agent to choose UART pins, PA10 TX and PA11 RX are preferred candidates if they are free and compatible with the selected UART instance. This pairing is also the verified UART0 baseline used by this skill.

For GPIO, PWM, SPI, I2C, timer capture, or other non-UART functions, continue to treat PA10/PA11 as special and prefer other available pins. Repurposing them may conflict with or remove the board's default UART connection, so explain that consequence first. For A21/PA21, A23/PA23, A02/PA02, and A18/PA18, prefer other available pins for ordinary assignments unless the user explicitly requests them or the existing project already deliberately uses them.

## PB22 LED Lessons

The LCKFB Tianmengxing onboard LED uses PB22. A verified GPIO blink used generated names similar to:

```c
LED_PORT
LED_PIN_22_PIN
SYSCFG_DL_init()
```

The original LED blink was a 32 MHz baseline using `delay_cycles(32000000)`.

## 80 MHz Clock Tree Lessons

The verified 80 MHz pattern uses HFXT 40 MHz on PA5/PA6, SYSPLL, ULPCLK divider 2, and MFCLK gate enabled.

SysConfig can generate successfully while warning:

```text
HFXT peripheral.$assign: Solution may have changed
HFXT peripheral.hfxInPin.$assign: Solution may have changed
HFXT peripheral.hfxOutPin.$assign: Solution may have changed
```

Do not hide this. Confirm generated `CPUCLK_FREQ`, `GPIO_HFXIN_*`, and `GPIO_HFXOUT_*`, or ask the user to inspect the clock tree GUI.

## UART0 Blocking TX Lessons

The verified UART smoke test used UART0 at 115200 8N1 with PA10/PA11 and a CH340 PC adapter. Treat it as a blocking transmit baseline, not a final DMA or variable-length receive design.

## Dual UART DMA TX + IRQ RX Lessons

The verified dual-UART smoke test used:

- UART0: PA10 TX / PA11 RX / DMA_CH0 / COM7
- UART1: PB6 TX / PB7 RX / DMA_CH1 / COM9
- Baud: 115200 8N1

PB6/PB7 must be crossed to the USB serial adapter: MCU TX PB6 to adapter RX, MCU RX PB7 to adapter TX, and common GND.

Important firmware lessons:

- Store DMA printf buffers per UART context, not in a function-static buffer shared by all UARTs.
- Use `char[]` RX buffers when printing with `%s`; keep flags and indexes volatile instead of making the whole text buffer volatile.
- Use `const char *fmt` for printf helpers because call sites usually pass string literals.
- If no DMA TX channel is configured, a fallback helper that accepts `len` should transmit exactly `len` bytes.
- Do not let an unknown UART instance fall back to IRQn 0; use a sentinel and fail the initialization.
- For low-rate single-command UARTs, `UART_RX_MODE_ISR_CALLBACK` can be convenient.
- For multiple UARTs or heavier parsing/formatting, prefer `UART_RX_MODE_POLL` or an RTOS task so RX ISRs stay short.
- `UART_RX_MODE_NONE` is useful for TX-only debug UARTs while still allowing `DMA_DONE_TX` interrupts to release the DMA busy flag.

## PWM Breathing LED Lessons

The verified PB22 PWM example used TIMG8 CCP1, a period of 1000 counts, and generated macro `GPIO_PWM_0_C1_IDX`.

Successful runtime pattern:

- set the first compare value before starting the timer
- update CCP1, not channel 0
- avoid exact compare boundaries `0` and `period`
- use `1..999` for a period of `1000`
- at 80 MHz, `delay_cycles(800000)` is roughly 10 ms per step

Failed patterns included one-second delay per brightness step and exact boundary values that made the LED appear off or glitchy.

## TIMG12 Periodic Interrupt Lessons

A verified timer interrupt smoke test used:

- CPUCLK: 80 MHz
- Timer: TIMG12
- TIMER period: 1 ms
- Generated load value: `79999U`
- ISR event: `DL_TIMER_IIDX_ZERO`
- Runtime behavior: toggle PB22 after 500 timer interrupts, so the LED state changes every 500 ms

At the original 32 MHz baseline, the same 1 ms timer generated a load value of `31999U`. After changing CPUCLK, rebuild and inspect the generated header instead of reusing an old load value.

Keep timing ownership split cleanly:

- `.syscfg`: timer instance, period, mode, interrupt event, clocks, and PB22 pinmux
- application code: `NVIC_EnableIRQ()`, `DL_TimerG_startCounter()`, a short ISR counter, and `DL_GPIO_togglePins()`

Do not blindly copy `SYSCTL.peripheral.$suggestSolution = "SYSCTL"` while adding this 80 MHz clock-tree pattern to an empty project. In the verified timer project this produced `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined`. Remove that copied line if SysConfig reports `SYSCTL.peripheral` is undefined. HFXT pinmux suggestions belong to `system.clockTree["HFXT"].peripheral`.

## Flash And Reset

Manual load-and-run after a clock-tree change can behave differently from a full reset. A verified 80 MHz test blinked at about 2.5 seconds immediately after plain flash, then about one second after board reset. DSLite `-r 2 -u` made automated flashing start correctly.

If J-Link connection fails after a previous attempt, stale `DSLite`, `JLink`, or `JLinkGUIServer` processes may need to be closed before retrying.
